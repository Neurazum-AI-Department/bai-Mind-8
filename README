# bai-Mind-8 Models

## Definition

bai Models are trained to recognize various tasks from brain waves. These versions are suitable for everyday use. They work with 8-channel EEG devices and are fully compatible with Neuramax.

This model family is a language model trained to transfer sentences from our minds to a computer. The model has been trained entirely for experimental purposes and is open to further development.

  ## Definition
  
  The bai-Mind-8 v1 model has been trained to work on 8-electrode EEG devices. It is the first of its kind in the world in the field of mind-language models. It has used the ZUCO dataset and other tokenizer models.

  Warning: This model shows low accuracy. All usage details and model architecture are located in the “v1” folder.

## Limitations & Considerations

**Important Notes:**

1. **Medical Use**: This models is for research purposes and should NOT replace professional medical diagnosis.
2. **Feature Dependency**: Requires specific  feature extraction pipeline.
3. **Patient Variability**: Performance may vary across different patients.
4. **Data Privacy**: EEG data must be handled with strict confidentiality.

## Acknowledgments

Some of these models use Neurazum's proprietary datasets. The data is closed-source and subject to privacy regulations. Models using open-source datasets are INDICATED.

## Note

**Use at your own risk. Due to the complexity of EEG signals and patient variability, accuracy rates may vary. The model should be used as a supportive tool, not as a replacement for professional medical judgment. Since the data belongs to , the function structure may change in future models.**
